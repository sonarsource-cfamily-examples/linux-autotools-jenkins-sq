= C++ example project scanned on SonarQube using Jenkins


It is very easy to analyze a C, C++ and Objective-C project with SonarQube in your Jenkins Pipelines:

. Create a `sonar-project.properties` file to store your configuration
. Follow the steps described in the https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/scan/sonarscanner-for-jenkins/[documentation of SonarScanner for Jenkins] 
.. Install and configure the "SonarQube Scanner for Jenkins" plugin in "Configure System" section
.. Configure the SonarScanner in "Global Tool Configuration" section
. Add a task to download the https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analyzing-source-code/languages/c-family/#using-build-wrapper/[Build Wrapper]
. Wrap your compilation with the Build Wrapper
. Launch the analysis using `withSonarQubeEnv` block


You can take a look at the link:sonar-project.properties[sonar-project.properties] and link:Jenkinsfile[Jenkinsfile] to see it in practice. Please be aware that the SonarQube server URL is not completed in this Jenkinsfile example.

= Code Description

An example of a flawed C++ code. The https://github.com/sonarsource-cfamily-examples/code[code repository] is meant to be compiled with different build systems using different CI pipelines on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

The https://github.com/sonarsource-cfamily-examples/code[code repository] is forked into other repositories in https://github.com/sonarsource-cfamily-examples[this collection] to add a specific build system, platform, and CI.
The downstream repositories are analyzed either with https://www.sonarqube.org/[SonarQube] or https://sonarcloud.io/[SonarCloud].
